        "description": "Hi there! We're Accrescent, an organization dedicated to building a modern Android app store focused on security, privacy, and usability.\n\nWe've been working on Accrescent since 2021 to improve security and privacy for everyday Android users. It is currently in alpha and is now serving about 20 apps submitted by a select number of developers to over 16,000 users worldwide.\n\nTo continue this work and grow Accrescent beyond alpha to accept apps from everyone, we need your help. Without sponsorship, our lead developer, lberrymage (https://github.com/lberrymage), is paying for Accrescent's development out of his own pocket. Your donations directly sustain Accrescent by covering continuing costs for servers, development work, and maintenance.\n\nBecause costs are continuing, even the smallest donation helps. Whatever you choose to give, thank you ❤️.",
