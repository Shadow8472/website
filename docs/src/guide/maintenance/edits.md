# App edits

## Introduction

App metadata (e.g. descriptions) is updated through edits. An edit is a set of changes to an app's
metadata. Once submitted and approved, all of an edit's changes are published simultaneously.

## Usage

To create an edit, follow the steps below

1. Navigate to "My apps" in the console sidebar.
2. Click the "View details" button on the app you wish to create an edit for.
3. At the top of the screen, you will see a "New edit" form. Fill out this form with the changes you
   want the edit to include.
4. Click "Create."

An edit will be created which can now be seen from the app details screen.

If you are satisfied with your edit's changes, click its "Submit" button. It will then be submitted
for review. If review passes, all of your changes in the edit will be published simultaneously.
