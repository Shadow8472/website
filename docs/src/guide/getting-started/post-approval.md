You can generate a clickable badge to advertise your app's presence on
Accrescent from the developer console. To do so, go to "My apps" and click
"More" on the app want to generate a badge for. You'll be presented with a
preview and with HTML source code to put on your website.

For next steps and how to update your app after it is published, see the [maintenance section] of
the guide.
