# Getting started

Developers manage their apps through the [Accroissant Developer Console]. To sign
up, visit the website and sign in with your GitHub account. _At this time only
whitelisted users are permitted to register_. You will be prompted to grant
Accroissant access to your GitHub email addresses. This is required so that
Accroissant can send email alerts when the status of your app changes.

After registering, you will be presented with a dashboard. From here you can
click "New app" to start the process of uploading a new app. But before you do,
be sure to read the rest of the publishing documentation.
