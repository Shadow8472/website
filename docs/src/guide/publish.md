# Publishing

Similar to the Play Store, all apps in Accroissant are submitted and updated by
their developers. This guide explains how to submit apps as a developer and the
requirements for them to be accepted.

If you're a developer new to Accroissant, we recommend reading the [getting
started guide](publish/getting-started.md) first. It explains how to sign up for
the Accroissant Developer Console and gives a high-level overview of how it
works. The other sections give more specific instructions for individual tasks.
