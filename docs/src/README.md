# Introduction

Accrescent is an Android app store focused on security, privacy, and usability.
This documentation currently covers how to use the Accrescent developer console,
although eventually it will contain much more in-depth discussion about its
inner workings, server infrastructure, etc..

If you're a developer new to Accrescent, we recommend reading the [getting started guide]
first. It explains how to sign up for the Accrescent Developer Console and gives a high-level
overview of how it works. The other sections give more specific instructions for individual tasks.
